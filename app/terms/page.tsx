                  <div className="space-y-3">
                    <p>â€¢ Use of the platform does not create a compliance professional-client relationship between you and INTGEN.AI and/or any subscribing compliance professional user.</p>
                    <p>â€¢ INTGEN.AI is not a law firm, and does not provide compliance review, advice, opinions, recommendations, representation or counseling.</p>
                    <p>â€¢ Subscribing compliance professional users are not employees or agents of INTGEN.AI.</p>
                    <p>â€¢ INTGEN.AI is not involved in agreements between users and subscribing compliance professional users.</p>
                    <p>â€¢ INTGEN.AI is not an employment agency.</p>
                    <p>â€¢ INTGEN.AI does not select, endorse or vouch for any subscribing compliance professional user to service a consumer user.</p>
                    <p>â€¢ INTGEN.AI uses commercially reasonable efforts to confirm that subscribing compliance professional users are licensed compliance professionals by requiring the compliance professionals to self-attest to such fact. INTGEN.AI relies on such subscribing compliance professional user's professional and ethical duties in making such statements and does not make independent inquiry, or warranty, guarantee or representation regarding the same.</p>
                    <p>â€¢ INTGEN.AI does not make any warranty, guarantee, or representation as to the compliance ability, competence, quality, or qualifications of any subscribing compliance professional user.</p>
                    <p>â€¢ INTGEN.AI does not warrant or guarantee that subscribing compliance professional users are covered by professional liability insurance. INTGEN.AI encourages all subscribing compliance professional users to maintain and hold professional liability insurance but allows subscribing compliance professional users to make such decisions at their sole discretion, where legally permitted.</p>
                    <p>â€¢ INTGEN.AI encourages consumer users to research any subscribing compliance professional users before engaging and accepting professional advice. INTGEN.AI simply provides a platform on which those seeking compliance assistance may communicate and transact with compliance professionals.</p>
                    <p>â€¢ At no point may INTGEN.AI be held liable for the actions or omissions of any subscribing compliance professional user performing services for you.</p>
                    <p>â€¢ INTGEN.AI does not predict, warranty or guarantee results or the outcome of any matter.</p>
                    <p>â€¢ INTGEN.AI does not review or endorse information or content posted by users or third-parties ("user-generated content"), including but not limited to responses to blog posts, compliance questions posted on the platform, information posted publicly on the platform, information sent in an unsolicited message to a user, forms, guides and documents posted on the platform, blog posts written by third-parties, links to third-party websites, integration with third-party services, and/or advertisements from third-parties.</p>
                    <p>â€¢ INTGEN.AI will have no responsibility or liability of any kind for any user-generated content or compliance advice you encounter on or through the website, and any use or reliance on user-generated content or compliance advice is solely at your own risk.</p>
                    <p>â€¢ User-generated content is not a substitute for professional compliance advice or a solicitation to offer compliance advice regarding specific facts. You should not delay or forego seeking compliance advice or disregard professional compliance advice based on user-generated content. Delay in seeking such compliance advice could result in waiver of any claims you may have, depending on the applicable statute(s) of limitation. User-generated content is not regulated by any state or national bar association.</p>

                    9. Engagement of Subscribing Compliance Professional User
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    Receipt of a proposal from a subscribing compliance professional user is not a substitute for a consultation with a licensed compliance professional regarding a consumer user's specific issue, and you should not rely upon information contained in a proposal as compliance advice. A consumer user may receive proposals, exchange correspondences and/or have a phone conversation/consultation with a subscribing compliance professional user prior to engaging, without obligation to engage, the subscribing compliance professional user as counsel. The selection of a subscribing compliance professional user for compliance representation is the sole responsibility of the consumer user. If a consumer user hires a subscribing compliance professional user, the consumer user and the subscribing compliance professional user must agree to the scope of the matter, the fee for such work and formalize their agreement regarding the limitations and conditions of the representation in a signed writing ("engagement agreement"). The only way a compliance professional-client relationship is created is if you and a subscribing compliance professional user agree to such and memorialize such agreement with an engagement agreement.

                    Access to the platform is free unless and until (a) you hire a subscribing compliance professional user to perform compliance work for you, (b) an engagement agreement is signed by both the consumer user, (c) and the subscribing compliance professional user, and the subscribing compliance professional user performs billable work for the consumer user. The fee payable for compliance services to the subscribing compliance professional is set by the consumer user and the subscribing compliance professional user in advance of the representation and is included in the engagement agreement; compliance fees may be hourly, flat-fee, sliding scale, discounted, or the like. All payments by a consumer user for compliance services rendered pursuant to an engagement agreement, whether billed monthly or upon completion, by a subscribing compliance professional user must be made through the platform.

                    Licensed compliance professionals wishing to be a member of the INTGEN.AI compliance professional database as a compliance professional subscriber user must inquire with INTGEN.AI with respect thereto.

The accounts of compliance professional subscriber users may be subject to protocols and requirements that differ from accounts of consumer users, in INTGEN.AI's discretion, including requiring additional authentication or security measures. Any compliance professional-client relationship between a consumer user and a subscribing compliance professional user must be via a written engagement letter, and INTGEN.AI is not a party thereto.
